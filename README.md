Program 1: Basic Mathematical Operations
Purpose:
To take two numbers from the user and perform basic arithmetic operations.

Functionality:

Input: Takes two numbers (num1 and num2) from the user.

Conversion: Converts the input values from strings to integers.

Operations Performed:

Addition: num1 + num2

Subtraction: num1 - num2

Multiplication: num1 * num2

Division: Checks if num2 is not zero, then performs num1 / num2; otherwise, returns a message.

Example Output:

Enter the first number: 5

Enter the second number: 10

Addition: 15  
Subtraction: -5  
Multiplication: 50  
Division: 0.5

Program 2: Personalized Greeting
Purpose:
To greet the user using their full name.

Functionality:

Input: Asks the user for their first name and last name.

Concatenation: Joins the first name and last name with a space in between to form the full name.

Output: Displays a welcome message using the full name.

Example Output:

Enter you first name: John

Enter you last name: Doe
